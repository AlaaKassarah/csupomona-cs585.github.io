		<h3>Objectives and Methodology</h3>

		<p>This course offers a survey and training of software testing, verification and validation techniques. This is a graduate course, and is designed to strike a balance between topics that are of a research focus, and topics that are more practical to software testing in the industry today. You will become acquainted with the trending software testing/verification tools, approaches, and practices, as well as working on a specific research topic that could either contribute to your Master project/thesis, or make a potential publication.</p>

		<h3>Schedule</h3>

		<p><a href="schedule.html">More information about the course's schedule</a>.</p>

		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

		<p>You should be comfortable writing code in Java. In addition, if you have not had the equivalent prerequisite of CS 480, you are advised to take them first.</p>

		<h3>Text</h3>

		<p>No textbook is required. All the key course content will be documented in slides, which will be available in the course website after each lecture.</p>		

		<h3>Assignments & Grading</h3>

		<p>There will be NO midterm or final exams for this course. The required work for this course includes:</p>

		<h4>Programming Assignment</h4> 

		<p>There will be one programming assignment to practice the techniques demonstrated in the course and reflect on their effectiveness.</p>

		<h4>Research Assignment</h4> 

		<p>The research assignment requires you to do some research on an existing programming language and its related testing tools. You will need to give a short presentation in class to talk about the result you find.</p>

		<h4>Course Project</h4> 

		<p>You will complete a small course project related with software testing, verification or validation techniques. You may select the topic from a list of given project ideas, or create your own idea.</p>

		<h3>Honor Code</h3>

		<p>Each student is to do his or her own work. This means that you are not to seek out the help of other students (or give help, if asked) in order to solve specific problems of your homework assignments. It also means that you should not sign up for mailing lists and ask for detailed help from others on the Internet. Of course, you may discuss generalities about an assignment with your fellow students. If you are unsure of what is permitted, in terms of discussing an assignment problem, please ask me for clarification.</p>

		<h3>Disabilities</h3>
		<p>If you have any disability that would put you at a disadvantage in performing an assignment, please meet with me privately to discuss ways in which I can assist you as you perform the required work in this course.</p>

		<h3>Tardiness</h3>
		<p>You are expected to arrive on time so that you do not cause a disruption in the middle of class. I would like to start the class at the scheduled time. If you cannot make it on time for some reason, please let me know. Persistent tardiness will be noted.</p>
